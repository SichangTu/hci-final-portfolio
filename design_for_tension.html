                <p>This group project aims to create a chatbot that could help our users correct common misconceptions
                    about women’s health. In this blog, I will first introduce the framing process of our chatbot,
                    defining the topic, the user group, and our goal. And then, I will illustrate how we ideate the
                    chatbot, including brainstorming, sketches, and flowchart. At last, I will present how we implement
                    the chatbot using

                    <p>As its name indicates, our chatbot is about women’s health. Here, the scope of ‘women’s health’
                        is widely-spread common misconceptions about women’s health on social media platforms such as
                        Facebook and Twitter. The usage of social media platforms has been vastly increased in recent
                        years. People are receiving various information from those platforms every day. However, some
                        information on social media might be extremely misleading.</p>

                    <p>Our group conducted research online and found that women’s health is one of the tensest topics.
                        The reasons include but are not limited to the following:</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12">
                            <ul class="default">
                                <li>People do not get enough education regarding women’s health and do not even think
                                    they should care about it.</li>
                                <li>People intentionally politicalize women’s bodies and choices while ignoring their
                                    actual needs and rights.</li>
                                <li>People tend to believe any widely believed information without checking its
                                    authenticity.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Though there are plenty of medical websites or official social media accounts that deliver the
                        correct information about women’s health, and people are recognizing that better sex education
                        and education of everyone about women’s bodies are necessary, misconceptions like ‘bras can
                        cause breast cancer’ are still spreading on the internet.</p>

                    <p>Based on our research results, our target user groups would be:</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12">
                            <ul class="default">
                                <li>People who have misconceptions about women’s health.</li>
                                <li>People who are unlikely to learn about women’s health actively, such as men.</li>
                                <li>People who have strong beliefs about policies related to women’s health.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Hence, our goal for the women’s health chatbot is to educate people by clarifying common
                        misconceptions and increasing the exposure of people to correct women’s health information. We
                        want to build a chatbot that pushes people out of their filter bubbles and is conversational and
                        friendly.</p>

                    <p>With all the work we did, we are finally able to generate the how-might-we statement: How might
                        we build a chatbot that can help users to learn more about women’s health in an interactive and
                        interesting way?</p>

                    <p>The tool we are using for this project is
                        <a class="web" href="https://flowxo.com/">Flow XO</a>.
                        It enables users to publish their chatbots on popular platforms like Facebook and Slack. Also,
                        it will generate a weblink for sharing the chatbot and embedding the chatbot on any webpage we
                        want.

                    <h4 class="subtitle">Brainstorming</h4>
                    <p>After deciding the topic, user groups, and the goal of our chatbot, our group started to
                        brainstorm by collecting existing common misconceptions and myths about women’s health online.
                    </p>

                    <p>Besides, we discussed what approaches should be used to guide our users to the goal via
                        conversation. We examined several methods within our group and decided to use the quiz as the
                        primary approach for our bot. The reason is twofold:</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12">
                            <ol class="default">
                                <li>The personality of our bot is friendly and helpful, using clear and conversational
                                    language. Using the quiz matches our design goal and our user groups. Timely
                                    responses after quiz questions will direct our users to the correct answers and
                                    helpful resources quickly.</li>
                                <li>A quiz is more exciting and interactive than just providing plain facts to the
                                    users. It will avoid driving our users away.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>We further created possible quiz questions according to previously collected misconceptions and
                        myths.</p>

                    <p>For each quiz question, we provide the question format (e.g., true/false, single choice), the
                        correct answer, a brief explanation of the answer, and the corresponding resources to the
                        question.</p>

                    <h4 class="subtitle">Sketching</h4>
                    <p>Apart from generating possible quiz questions, our group also created sketches for the chatbot,
                        visualizing the flow of the conversation before we implemented our ideas.</p>

                    <h4 class="subtitle">Formative User Testing</h4>
                    <p>Before we started programming, we conducted informal user testing on our design. The goal of this
                        user testing is to answer the following two questions:</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12">
                            <ul class="default">
                                <li>How many questions are appropriate for the quiz?</li>
                                <li>How does the user prefer to quit the chatbot?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The test results show that over 66% of users (8 out of 12) think 8~10 quiz questions would be
                        appropriate. Hence, we decided to create a 10-question quiz for the chatbot.</p>

                    <p>As for the second problem, we split users into 2 groups. Group 1 will be asked if they want to
                        quit after every quiz question, while Group 2 are told at the beginning of the quiz they can
                        leave at any time they want. The result shows that Group 1 answered 2 questions on average. But
                        Group 2 answered all questions. So, we decided to tell users that they can quit at any time.</p>

                    <h3 class="major">Implementation</h4>
                        <p>My main contribution to the implementation is creating the framework of our chatbot, the main
                            menu and bot info flow, and part of the health resources flow using Flow XO. In order to
                            present our bot in a clear and straightforward way, I also drew a high-level flowchart for
                            our bot.</p>

                        <p>As shown in the above screenshot, the chatbot contains 3 flows, including <i>Take Quiz</i>,
                            <i>View
                                Health Resources</i>, and <i>View Bot Info</i>. Due to the limitation of the Flow XO
                            free account (3
                            flows max), I combined the main menu with <i>Bot Info</i>. Users can freely choose which
                            section
                            they would like to go to, and will be asked if they would like to make another query or go
                            back to the main menu at the end of each section. And if the answer is no, the conversation
                            will end.
                        </p>

                    <h3 class="major">Final User Testing</h3>
                    <p>After the implementation, we tested our chatbot with real people and collected their thoughts.
                    </p>

                    <p>According to the test results, our chatbot did well on:</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12">
                            <ol class="default">
                                <li>Providing helpful resources.</li>
                                <li>Using emoji to encourage the user.likely to learn about women’s
                                    health actively, such as men.</li>
                                <li>Using emoji to encourage the user.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>And the chatbot also needs improvements regarding:</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12">
                            <ol class="default">
                                <li>More specific question description. For example, ‘birth control pills’ refer to
                                    urgent birth control pills like plan b or long-term birth control pills.</li>
                                <li>It would be great if users can input keywords to search for related articles.</li>
                                <li>Resources are too long to read. Better if they can be article titles with
                                    hyperlinks.</li>
                                <li>More detailed feedback. For example, which topic does the user get the most scores
                                    on.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>These feedback are valuable and could guide us to further improve the design of our chatbot.</p>
