                <p>Nowadays, the heavy usage of smart devices, such as phones, smartwatches, and voice assistants, leads
                    to the increasing interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). With the development of Machine
                    Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence, the interaction between humans and computers is
                    ever-changing, which poses a great influence on our daily lives.</p>

                <p>As a student who studies computer science, I used to focus only on developing the model behind the
                    products but have never thought about how design can help humans better interact with computers.
                    Thanks to the HCI course provided by Dr. Amily Wall at Emory University, I had the opportunity to
                    get to know this field and participate in every step of the design process, including problem
                    defining, information collecting, brainstorming & analyzing, developing solutions, gathering
                    feedback, and improving the design.</p>

                <p>My design experience over the last four months has enabled me to approach problems from a totally
                    different perspective as a designer. This manifesto will illustrate the most important takeaways I
                    learned from the past design process. These takeaways are also the design philosophy that I would
                    like to keep in mind and follow in my future design work.</p>

                <section class="article">
                    <h3 class="major">Design Philosophy</h3>

                    <h4 class="subtitle">User-centered not Self-Centered</h4>

                    <blockquote>Because everyone’s problems are personal and have different causes and consequences,
                        there is no such thing as the “average user”. Every single solution will meet some people’s
                        needs while failing to meet others.
                        — Amy J. Ko</blockquote>

                    <p>The first and most important thing I learned from my experience is that we always keep in mind
                        that we are designing for users, not ourselves. And this principle should be followed throughout
                        the entire design process.</p>

                    <p>Starting from the problem defining, one mistake I made at the beginning of my first project was
                        to assume the needs of users. When I was working on one project named
                        <a class="web" href="need_finding.html">Need Finding</a>,
                        in which we needed to understand users’ real needs in one specific domain. I chose the
                        <i>in-flight entertainment screen</i>
                        as my topic. Before interviewing the participants, I thought I would get
                        ideas like ‘the machine is too old’ or ‘it should allow users to access streaming services’.
                        However, to my surprise, none of my interviewees shared the same thought as mine. Take one of my
                        interviewees as an example (P1). What P1 cares about most is the missing movie sync function and
                        food ordering function on the in-flight entertainment screen.

                    <p>This is exactly what Dr. Amy J. Ko conveys in her blog,
                        <a class="web" href="https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/understand">How to
                            understand problems</a>.
                        Our unique
                        experiences shape our thoughts. No one’s experiences are the same, so no one’s problems are the
                        same. And there is no one solution for all problems. What designers should do is to conduct
                        thoughtful user research. We could communicate with users to understand their problems by using
                        surveys, interviews, and observations. And we could use methods like the <a class="web"
                            href="https://emilywall.github.io/hci/assignments/d_school.pdf#page=18">empathy map</a> and

                        to identify surprise and contradictions.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="subtitle">Expectation V.S. Reality</h4>

                    <blockquote>“Thinking is easy, acting is difficult, and to put one’s thoughts into action is the
                        most difficult thing in the world.”
                        ― Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</blockquote>

                    <p>In the design process, it is easy to imagine what our designs would be like. However, realizing
                        it in real life is another thing. The gif below well describes the gap between our expectations
                        and reality. The ideation might be neat and straightforward in our heads, but the realization is
                        much more complicated. Likely, we will encounter various constraints and issues in the design
                        process. It could be time limit, technology barrier, required skills, or user behaviors.</p>

                    </section>

                    <p>I realized this gap when I was working on the <a class="web"
                            href="design_for_understanding.html">Design for Understanding</a> project. In this data
                        visualization project, we tried to map the <a class="web"
                            href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/billionaires/">Billionaire</a> dataset to visual
                        features in both
                        communicative and persuasive ways. Another and I were responsible for creating the unbiased and
                        in-depth presentation of the dataset. During the ideation process, we planned to use Tableau to
                        create an interactive world map that can show the distribution of billionaires by region and
                        country. The larger the dot is, the more billionaires are in that region. If the user clicks on
                        the dots, the map will zoom in to the corresponding area and show the detailed data. I spent
                        days implementing the interactive world map. However, I later found out that our data is too
                        sparse and does not create a satisfying visualization. Hence, I have to switch to a simpler but
                        effective way, using the treemap to present the distribution.</p>

                    <p>This experience also affected my design philosophy. It is normal that we will undergo various
                        constraints during the design process, and sometimes the end product may not be the same as we
                        expected. I summarized a helpful tip from the data visualization project — Be flexible and open
                        to the changes. In most cases, our ideas may change as the design process continues. After all,
                        the ultimate goal of our design process is to create a useful and user-friendly product, rather
                        than insisting on what we planned.</p>

                    <h4 class="subtitle">Detail Matters</h4>

                    <blockquote>“The details are not the details. They make the design.”
                        — Charles Eames</blockquote>

                    <p>The detail of the design contains a wide range of aspects, including typography, color, icons,
                        margin, design patterns, and consistency. A good design should take all details into
                        consideration.</p>

                    <p>An example from my design experience is the importance of button locations in the project <a
                            class="web" href="design_for_others.html">Design
                            for Others</a>. I worked on the design of the <i>Upcoming Event</i> page of the Fox Theatre
                        mobile website.
                        The design received overall positive feedback from users. However, one feedback caught my
                        attention. The user reported that the location of the ‘Clear’ button and ‘Apply’ button (circled
                        in the following picture) on the Filters page is unintuitive. And the user mistakenly clicked on
                        the ‘Clear’ button during the usability test.</p>

                    </section>

                    <p>Later, I swapped the location of the ‘Clear’ and ‘Apply’ buttons on that page. And we did not
                        receive similar comments after that. It occurs to me that small changes can make such a huge
                        difference. One detail in the design may cause errors and thus bring a frustrating user
                        experience. So, be sensitive to every detail in your design! It is difficult to cover all
                        details at the beginning. One good way to start with visual design is to refer to resources like
                        <a class="web"
                            href="https://medium.com/designatmeta/how-to-make-your-not-so-great-visual-design-better-67972eee3825">this</a>.

                    <h4 class="subtitle">Feedback Helps</h4>

                    <blockquote>“I think it’s very important to have a feedback loop, where you’re constantly thinking
                        about what you’ve done and how you could be doing it better.”
                        – Elon Musk</blockquote>

                    <p>Design is never like a straight line where we can go from the start point directly to the
                        destination. We always need to decide on different design ideas, and go back and forth to
                        improve our design. User feedback and user testing play a significant role in this process.</p>

                    <p>In one of my projects, <a class="web" href="design_for_tension.html">Design for Tension</a>, my
                        team and I created a chatbot that helps users to better understand women’s health. We decided to
                        use quizzes as the primary approach for our bot since it is more exciting and interactive than
                        providing plain facts. However, we could not decide how many questions we should put into the
                        quiz and how the user prefers to end the conversation. To address these two critical problems,
                        we conducted formative user testing. Based on the feedback, we quickly figured out the answers.
                        So, when you are indecisive in the design process, do not hesitate to ask and listen to your
                        users!</p>

                    <p>Feedback also helps when designers try to improve their products. For instance, when I worked on
                        the project <a class="web" href="redesign.html">Redesign and Extend</a>, our team adopted the <a
                            class="web" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/">usability
                            test</a> during the iteration of the design. We asked the user to rate our product on a
                        scale of 1–5 given the following metrics. The feedback shows our product should be improved in
                        terms of <b>Intuitive design</b> and <b>Error frequency and severity</b>.</p>

                    <p>Learning how to receive feedback and survive a critique is an indispensable skill for every
                        designer. We could apply useful methods, such as the <a class="web"

                            test</a> to gather them. As Karen Cheng suggests in <a class="web"

                            article</a>, we should invite constructive criticism, keep an open mind, and avoid being

                    <h4 class="subtitle">Review Your Design</h4>

                    <blockquote>“You need to have a redesign because familiarity breeds a kind of complacency.”
                        — Timothy White</blockquote>

                    <p>Another important concept I learned from my design experience is that the design process is a
                        loop. It does not end when you think you find the solution for the problem defined in step 1.
                        Designers should improve their design according to users’ feedback, identify new problems, and
                        repeat the whole design process.</p>

                    <p>In the <a class="web" href="redesign.html">Redesign and Extent for Fox Theatre</a>, our team
                        aimed to redesign the mobile website based
                        on our <a class="web" href="https://www.figma.com/file/XqWGlUM2XaoNqj2Mbw8nTX/Sketch">original
                            Figma prototype</a>. We created a design process board to collect information in
                        each design step, in which we tried to iterate the design process and redesign based on the
                        newly identified problems.</p>

                    <p>Using this method, we jumped out of the original design and found previously ignored problems,
                        including the missing ‘backward’ function on all the pages we created. The negligence is because
                        we are too familiar with our own design and often fail to recognize the potential problems. Even
                        design experts are possible to be traped by familiarity. Hence, it is necessary to review and
                        redesign your project, which will give you a whole new perspective to the problem.</p>

                    <h4 class="subtitle">Inclusive Design</h4>

                    <blockquote>We should all … understand how each of us is an individual and is unique, but also focus
                        on what is universally important to all of us. That way, we can increase access, reduce
                        friction, create a more emotional connection — in literally whatever you design.
                        — Tim Allen</blockquote>

                    <p>Seeking inclusive solutions in our design is quite challenging. There are two concepts that are
                        closely related to inclusive design: <a class="web"
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A88E4DH2asQ">universal design</a> and <a class="web"
                            href="http://web.mit.edu/6.813/www/sp18/classes/18-accessibility/">accessibility design</a>.
                        The former
                        refers to creating one experience that could be accessed by all the people, while the latter
                        allows people with disabilities and impairments to use the design. Hence, the goal of inclusive
                        design is to design products that can be used by people of all backgrounds and abilities.</p>

                    <p>I worked on a project named <a class="web"
                            href="https://medium.com/@tusichang/climbing-towards-design-7fdc24c7ce2#campus_access">Campus/Town
                            Accessibility</a>, inspired by the <a class="web"
                            href="https://sidewalk-sea.cs.washington.edu/">Project Sidewalk</a>. For this
                        project, I assumed myself as a person with mobility impairments and would like to go grocery
                        shopping at a Whole Foods Market nearby my department. I created an annotated map of the
                        routine, labeling both accessible options and problematic areas I found along the road.</p>

                    <p>I was surprised to find that there are so many problematic areas that may cause potential dangers
                        to people with disabilities. For example, one problematic area has a severe surface problem. The
                        cracks on the sidewalk will create an extremely uncomfortable experience for people with
                        wheelchairs and other assistive devices. Also, the sidewalk is too narrow to allow the
                        wheelchair to rotate.</p>

                    <p>From this experience, I realized that inclusive design has been largely ignored in our daily
                        lives. The valuable lesson I learned from it is that consider every “edge case” in our design
                        process. As designers, we should always bear in mind that people around us are diverse. And we
                        need to develop empathy to understand the diversity. For example, when we are testing our
                        products, we should hire people from all backgrounds and abilities.</p>

                    <p>To conclude, I would like to quote a sentence from Hillman Curtis.</p>

                    <blockquote>“The goal of a designer is to listen, observe, understand, sympathize, empathize,
                        synthesize, and glean insights that enable him or her to ‘make the invisible visible.’
                        — Hillman Curtis</blockquote>

                    <p>For me, the HCI experience is like climbing mountains. I encountered various design challenges
                        and experienced frustrating moments. However, I am also able to observe a lot of previously
                        ‘invisible’ views and hope to find more during the journey. Though I am no expert in this field,
                        I still hope this manifesto would help people who are new to HCI and would encourage more people
                        to join this journey.</p>
