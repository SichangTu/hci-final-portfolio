                <p>Accessibility design is especially important for users with disability. According to the report by
                    U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 1 in 5 people have a disability in the U.S. And roughly 30.6 million had
                    difficulty walking or climbing stairs or used a wheelchair, cane, crutches, or walker [1]. Hence,
                    the accessibility design for people with mobility impairments is crucial. This assignment is to
                    investigate the accessibility of pathways around town. This work is inspired by the
                    <a class="web" href="https://sidewalk-sea.cs.washington.edu/">Project Sidewalk</a>,
                    a project that allows volunteers to label the accessibility sidewalks on the interactive virtual map
                    and thus create an accessibility map.

                    <p>The investigated area I chose is in North Decatur. I assumed myself as a person with mobility
                        impairment and wanted to do grocery shopping at a Whole Foods Market nearby. As shown in the
                        screenshot above, I labeled the map with 6 different icons and routes in 2 different colors.</p>

                    <p>The route in red shows the route I took from the apartment to the grocery store, while the route
                        in blue gives the path I walked from the grocery store to the apartment building.</p>

                    <p>The first good accessible option is found at the entrance of the Truist building. There is a
                        large disabled parking space in front of the building with a striped area that allows people
                        with disability to go onto the sidewalk through the ramp and thus access the building.</p>

                    <p>The above picture shows the intersection of North Decatur Road and Church Street. The reason why
                        I picked this location is that the curb ramp at this intersection is broad enough for people
                        with wheelchairs to navigate even if there is a high traffic flow. Also, the slope of the curb
                        ramp is very friendly, which does not pose challenges for disabled people to go through.</p>

                    <p>This picture was taken in front of my destination, Whole Foods Market. It is great that grocery
                        stores like Whole Food provide a large sloped area in front of their entrance. People with
                        wheelchairs can easily move onto the sidewalk and enter the store.</p>

                    <p>The picture above is a part of the sidewalk near the Whole Foods Market. As we can see, the road
                        condition is really bad. All the cracks and stones on the surface would lead to an extremely
                        uncomfortable experience for anyone that uses a wheelchair. And the sidewalk is too narrow, the
                        wheelchair cannot even rotate.</p>

                    <p>This picture provides another bad example. As shown in the picture, the sidewalk ends abruptly
                        and there is no alternative way on this side of the road. The only option is to go across the
                        grass area, which is difficult for people with mobility impairment.</p>

                    <p>The last example I chose is labeled as <b>Not Passable</b>. The only option passengers have to go
                        to the next sidewalk is the stairs. Otherwise, passengers will have to walk on the street.
                        Hence, it is dangerous for people with mobility impairment to go through this location.</p>

                    <p>This assignment provides a great opportunity for me to better understand the urgency and
                        importance of the accessibility design for people with mobility impairment.</p>
