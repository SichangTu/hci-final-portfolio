                <h3 class="major">Good Design</h3>
                <h4 class="subtitle">What is it?</h4>
                <p>The good design I chose is the homepage of the
                    <a class="web" href="https://transportation.emory.edu/">Emory Transportation website</a>.
                    As shown in the screenshot below, the webpage contains mainly three sections
                    besides the top navigation bar and footer. The first section contains
                    1) a rotating banner of important events and information; 2) a Discover
                    function that enables users to locate the information they are looking for
                    quickly. The second section shows the latest news and social media content.
                    And the last section offers a more detailed site map.
                </p>

                <section class="features" class="article">
                    <div class="box alt">
                        <div class="row gtr-uniform">
                            <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/good_design.jpeg" alt="" />
                                </span></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <p>This website is designed for students, faculties and visitors who want to acquire
                    transportation information (e.g., shuttles, parking, and commute). Take myself
                    as an example. When I came to Emory for the first time, I used this website to
                    look up the shuttle route and schedule from my apartment to the school. And
                    later, when I purchased a car, I used this website to apply for my parking permit.</p>

                <h4 class="subtitle">Why is it?</h4>
                <p>The reason why I think this website is a good design are as follows:</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-12">
                        <ol class="default">
                            <li>The UI design is clean and uncluttered. The website places the most important
                                information in the unfolding area to make it easier for users to find the
                                information they are interested in. It also provides a detailed site map for some
                                uncommon functions or less critical information.</li>
                            <li>The website did well in terms of <i>discoverability</i> and <i>understanding</i>.
                                For example, the Discover function in the first section provides a fill-in-blank
                                sentence (‘I am a ___, interested in ___.’) to guide the user. So the affordance is
                                fully visible. Also, they put signifiers ‘Select One’ so that users will understand
                                that they can select different options from the drop-down menu.</li>
                            <li>The website has immediate feedback. Generally, the operation on this website is
                                smooth. If you use the Discover function mentioned in reason 2, it will redirect you
                                to another web page that contains further information once you fill in the two
                                options.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </div>



                <section class="article">
                    <h3 class="major">Bad Design</h3>

                    <h4 class="subtitle">What is it?</h4>

                    <p>The bad design I chose is the
                        <a class="web" href="https://emap.fmd.emory.edu/website/campus/index.htm">Emory interactive
                            map</a>.
                        This website allows users to look up all buildings and directions on the campus. As shown in the
                        screenshot, the website provides a campus tour video on the top of the left sidebar. Using the
                        search box in the left sidebar, users can search for buildings. The detailed information will
                        show
                        up as a pop-up window in the map area. Also, users can select different types of map views in
                        the
                        top right corner and zoom in/out in the bottom right corner.
                    </p>

                    <section class="features" class="article">
                        <div class="box alt">
                            <div class="row gtr-uniform">
                                <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/bad_design.png" alt="" />
                                    </span></div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </section>

                    <p>This interactive map is designed for anyone that wants to inquire more information about the
                        campus
                        building and directions. People will use it if they need to get familiar with the campus or if
                        they
                        would like to find specific facilities within the campus (e.g., parking lots and emergency phone
                        locations).</p>

                    <h4 class="subtitle">Why is it?</h4>

                    <p>For this website, I think there are few things that it does not do well:</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12">
                            <ol class="default">
                                <li>The website places the signifier ‘Emory Campus Tour’ on the top of the left sidebar.
                                    But when the user clicks on it, a side window will show up and tell the user the
                                    video is unavailable. So the feedback here is poor, which may annoy the users.</li>
                                <li>Some information provided on this website is hard to understand. As shown in the
                                    pop-up window in the map area, the detailed information of one building contains its
                                    address and several links to different locations, such as Severe Weather Location
                                    and AED location. The confusing part is that users may not understand what Severe
                                    Weather location and AED location mean and how they should use them. If we click on
                                    the Severe Weather Location, another pop-up window will show up below, which is even
                                    more confusing. There is no way a first-time user would know what E110 (Hallway)
                                    stands for. Again, the design of this website does not communicate the necessary
                                    message.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                    </div>
